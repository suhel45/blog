        <h1 class="text-center">difference between local storage and session storage</h1>
        <p class="container "> <span class="fw-bold">Answer:</span> The read-only sessionStorage property 
       accesses a session Storage object for the current origin. sessionStorage is similar to localStorage; 
       the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared 
       when the page session ends.</p>
       <h1 class="text-center">difference between global scope and block scope in javascript</h1>
       <p class="container "> <span class="fw-bold">Answer:</span> Global Scope
        The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.
        And
        Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.</p>
